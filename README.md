# MNIST Digit Recognizer Nueral Network in C

I was curious about what was under the hood of the code that drives a lot of the machine learning foundations, so I decided to do a deep dive and build it from scratch.
I built a NN based on this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&t=564s. The concept is the same: instead of using the abstracted high level functions, try to build a NN from scratch with only the simplest. 
And what better way to do that than by doing in a lower level language than what was in the video, in C! 


## Result
